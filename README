Suelta - A pure-Python SASL client library

Suelta is a SASL library, providing you with authentication and in some cases
security layers. It was originally written by Dave Cridland, and represents the
ripping asunder of the SASL bits of Polymer.

It supports a wide range of typical SASL mechanisms, including the MTI for
all known protocols.

Now used in SleekXMPP, and Python 3-ized by Lance Stout.
