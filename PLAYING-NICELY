Hi.

This is a short note explaining the license in non-legally-binding terms, and
describing how I hope to see people work with the licensing.

First off, the license is permissive, and more or less allows you to do
anything, as long as you leave my credit and copyright intact.

You can, and are very much welcome to, include this in commercial works, and
in code that has tightly controlled distribution, as well as open-source.

If it doesn't work - and I have no doubt that there are bugs - then this is
largely your problem.

If you do find a bug, though, do let me know - although you don't have to.

And if you fix it, I'd greatly appreciate a patch, too. Please give me a
licensing statement, and a copyright statement, along with your patch.

Similarly, any enhancements are welcome, and also will need copyright and
licensing. Please stick to a license which is compatible with the MIT license,
and consider assignment (as required) to me to simplify licensing. (Public
domain does not exist in the UK, sorry).

Thanks,

Dave.
